## 1. Overview of Worked Example

### a) Background

There are many ways graphs can be implemented to understand population structure and relate that structure to landscape characteristics (see Dyer and Nason 2004). In this exercise, we will focus on one specialized case.  

Gravity models are a type of inferential model that exploit graph characteristics. Gravity models include both at-site and between-site landscape data. They are a type of graph consisting of nodes and edges. These nodes and edges of landscape characteristics associated with these graph elements.

### b) Data set

In this exercise, you will use the gravity model framework to build an empirical model of gene flow for the Columbia spotted frog dataset in central Idaho that you have used for several other exercises (Murphy et al. 2010).

Several data files are included with the GeNetIT package:

- **Dps**: genetic distance in proportion of shared alleles.
- **ralu.site**: this is a shape file with wetland data and spatial locations
- **rasters**: 30 m rasters of landscape variables. 


### c) Required R libraries

All required packages should have been installed already when you installed 'LandGenCourse'.

```{r packages global_options, include=TRUE, results="hide", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(LandGenCourse)
library(sp)
#require(raster)
#require(rgdal)
#require(raster)
#require(GeNetIt)
#require(spdep)
#require(maptools)
#require(RANN)
#require(spatialEco)
#require(GeNetIt)
```

### d) Import data

Data for exercise:

```{r}
data(dps, package="GeNetIt")
data(ralu.site, package="GeNetIt")
data(rasters, package="GeNetIt")
```

Coerce 'SpatialPixelsDataFrame' to raster stack. First, create a stack for the continuous variables:

```{r}
xvars <- raster::stack(rasters[-6]) 
```

You'll need to treat the land cover variable separately because it is a factor:

```{r}
land.cov <- raster::stack(rasters[6]) 
```

Plot sample locations:

```{r}
par(mar = c(0,0,0,0))
sp::plot(ralu.site)
```

Plot the raster data (we also did this in the Week 2 & 11 labs):

```{r fig.height=4.7, fig.width=7}
raster::plot(xvars)
```

### e) Derive at-site covariates by extracting raster point values

Note: see also the Week 2 Worked Example.

At each sample site, extracting values from cti and err27 as at-site variables:  

```{r}
ralu.site@data <- data.frame(ralu.site@data, 
                  raster::extract(xvars[[c(1,2)]], ralu.site))
```

Take a look at the resulting data

```{r}
head(ralu.site@data)  
```

## 2. Create a k-Nearest-Neighbours (kNN) graph

The next step is to create a graph. In this case, you will first create a saturated graph (each site connected to all other sites).

Start by creating a kNN graph from the site data (ralu.site) using the function `knn.graph`.

Note: you can limit the graph by maximum distance (max.dist) if desired, as shown in the second line of code that is commented out.

```{r}
dist.graph <- GeNetIt::knn.graph(ralu.site, 
                row.names = ralu.site@data[,"SiteName"]) 
#dist.graph <- knn.graph(ralu.site, row.names = ralu.site@data[,"SiteName"], max.dist = 5000)
```

Add "from.to" unique ID's and merge with genetic distance matrix: 
```{r}
dist.graph@data$from.to <- paste(dist.graph$i, 
                                 dist.graph$j, sep=".")
dps$from.to <- paste(dps$FROM_SITE, dps$TO_SITE, sep=".") 
dist.graph <- merge(dist.graph, dps, by = "from.to") 
```

Merge graph with at site nodes: 
  
```{r}
dist.graph@data <- dist.graph@data[,-c(7,8)]
```

Remove NA values:
  
```{r}
na.index <- unique(as.data.frame(which(is.na(dist.graph@data), 
                                       arr.ind = TRUE))[,1])
dist.graph <- dist.graph[-na.index, ]
```

Display columns and plot:

```{r fig.width=4.5}
str(dist.graph@data) 
par(mar=c(2.5,2,0.5,4))
plot(xvars[[2]])
plot(dist.graph, add=T)
points(ralu.site, pch=20, col="red")
```

**Challenge**: Red on green can be difficult to discern.  Can you change the symbol and color for the sample sites?

**Question 1**: 

- What are some other methods for “pruning” this graph?
- What would be an ecologically justifiable way of determining a maximum distance?

## 3. Add covariates to edges by calculating raster summary statistics

### a) Summary statistics along edges for quantitative raster data

You can calculate any statistical moment (e.g., mean, standard deviation) to summarize the values between sites. This examples uses min, mean, max and variance. 

Note: to calculate these summary statistics, the data need to be numeric. All variables used here are coded as floating point data. Calculating statistical moments of categorical data (such as land cover) does not make sense as these values represent categories (names) and not numerical values.

Arguments:

- **x**: an 'sp' class 'SpatialLinesDateFrame' object.  In this case, the 'dist.graph'.
- **r**: the raster stack (the predictor, or x, variables)
- **d**: the distance between samples on the edges (in the units of the data). In this case, 30 m because the data are 30 meter resolution. If we sample a point every 30 m along the edge, we essentially sample every cell along the vector.  
- **stats**: the statistics calculated. You can pass a custom statistical function.
- **sp**: if TRUE would include a 'sp' class 'SpatialPOintsDataFrame' of the line point samples (this takes a lot of space).

```{r}
stats <- GeNetIt::graph.statistics(dist.graph, r = xvars, d=30, 
            stats = c("min", "mean", "max", "var"), sp = FALSE) 
dist.graph@data <- data.frame(dist.graph@data, stats)
```

### b) Summary statistics along edges for categorical raster data

To summarize categorical raster data, you need to extract one land cover type at a time. In this example, the goal is to quantify percent wetland landcover along each edge based on the NLCD data.

First, create a class that contains all wetlands from the NLDC data. There are multiple categories that are wetlands.

Define a function `wet.pct` that returns, for each cell in raster 'x', the value '1' if the cell is wetland (land cover types 11, 12, 90 or 95) and '0' if it is any other cover type.

```{r}
wet.pct <- function(x) { 
  x <- ifelse( x == 11 |  x == 12 | x == 90 | x == 95, 1, 0)
  prop.table(table(x))[2] 
}
```
  
Now, apply the function 'wet.pct' to calculate the percent wetland along each edge. Note that as in the Worked Example from Week 11, these are not distances but % of cells that are wetlands.  

```{r}
lc.stats <- GeNetIt::graph.statistics(dist.graph, r = land.cov, 
                                      d=30, stats = "wet.pct")
```

There may be cells with missing land cover data. Set their wetland status to '0':

```{r}
lc.stats[is.na(lc.stats)] <- 0
```  

Add the new covariates to 'dist.graph@data' and check with 'str':

```{r}
dist.graph@data <- data.frame(dist.graph@data, lc.stats)
str(dist.graph@data)
```

**Challenge**: Can you calculate a variable that is percent forest between sites?  For the NLCD legend, see https://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd06_leg.php.  

**Question 2**: What other statistical moments might be informative? 

**Question 3**: Why are you calculating % of habitat and not amount for nlcd data (wet.pct)?  

**Question 4**: We know functional connectivity of organisms (animals,  pollen/seeds) are influenced by more than a 30 m line.  How might we account for this reality within this modeling framework?

## 4. Fit gravity model 

Now we are ready for the actual gravity model analysis. There are a few things to remember:

1.	In order to solve the gravity form, we take the natural log of all dependent and independent variables.  
2.	The dependent variable (y) is the genetic distance ($T_{ij}$ in the gravity model).
3.	The independent variables (x) fall into the three components of the gravity model: 
    - distance (w), 
    - at site (v), and 
    - between site (c).

### a) Build data for gravity model 

Define 'from' and 'to' node (site) for each edge, and a table 'site' that contains the nodes.

```{r}
from <- ralu.site@data[,c(1,6,8,18,19)]
names(from)[2:ncol(from)] <- 
  paste("f",names(from)[2:ncol(from)], sep=".") 
to <- ralu.site@data[,c(1,6,8,18,19)]
names(to)[2:ncol(to)] <- 
  paste("t", names(to)[2:ncol(to)], sep=".") 
site <- data.frame(from,to)  
site <- site[,-(dim(to)[2]+1)]
```

Combine data:

```{r}
cdata <- merge(dist.graph, site, by.x="from_ID", by.y="SiteName") 
cdata$Dps <- 1 - cdata$Dps
cdata <- cdata@data
```

### b) Specify and fit gravity model  

Specify parameters:

- **cti**: compound topographic index (wetness index)
- **err27**: elevation relief ratio (measure of topographic complexity, 27X27 window)
- **gsp**: growing season precipitation
- **wet.pct**: percent wetland between sites
- **f.AREA_m2**: wetland area of the “from” site in meters squared
- **f.Depth_m**: wetland depth of the “from” site, this is highly correlated with predatory fish
- **f.err27**: elevation relief ratio at the wetland
- **length**: distance between sites in meters

```{r}
x = c("length", "mean.cti", "mean.err27", "mean.ffp", "mean.gsp",
      "f.AREA_m2", "f.Depth_m", "f.err27")
```

Fit gravity model:

- **group**: this sets the constraint. Here, "from_ID" specifies a 'from' node constraint (singly constrained production model)
- **method**: for model selection, use ML (maximum likelihood).  For parameter estimation, use REML (restricted maximum likelihood)

```{r}
gm <- GeNetIt::gravity(y = "Dps", x = x, d = "length", 
           group = "from_ID", method="ML",data = cdata) 
```

Plot model results:  

```{r fig.height=5.5, fig.width=7}
par(mfrow=c(2,3))
for (i in 1:6) { plot(gm, type=i) } 
```

**Question 5**: The data can be constrained by origin (from site) or destination (to sites).  

- How is the model constrained?    
- How would you change the code to alter the type of constraint?  
- Decide if you think it makes more ecological/biological sense to constrain by origin (From) or destination (To).

### c) Try a second model  

```{r}
x = c("length", "mean.cti", "mean.err27", "mean.ffp", "wet.pct.nlcd",   
      "f.Depth_m", "f.cti")

( gm.2 <- GeNetIt::gravity(y = "Dps", x = x, d = "length", 
            group = "from_ID", method= "ML", data = cdata) )
```

```{r fig.height=5.5, fig.width=7}
par(mfrow=c(2,3))
for (i in 1:6) { plot(gm.2, type=i) } 
```

## 5. Building your own models and model selection 

Now is your opportunity to build your own models. Apply what you learned from the Model Selection lab.  

- Select 5 candidate models to test with a clear ecological/biological a priori justification – all of these models should include the distance (length) term and the grouping factor.  

- Please include both a null model (grouping factor, distance, no other parameters) and a global model.  

- Use the correlation matrices to test for collinearity among model terms.  

You will use your information to fill out the table below. To see potential variables, type names(cdata).  

**Challenge**: You can also try applying other networks to these data.

![Table for your results](WE13_Fig1.png)

### a) Description of potential variables

- **length**: distance between sites (in meters)
- **cti**: compound topographic index
- **hli**: heat load index
- **err**: elevation relief ratio (27X27 window)
- **ffp**: frost free period
- **gsp**: growing season precipitation
- **wet**: percent wetland (CHALLENGE- you could calculate other habitat variables from the nlcd data)
- **.var**: variance (of values along the edge)
- **.min**: minimum value (of values along the edge)
- **.max**: maximum value (of values along the edge)
- **.mean**: mean value (of values along the edge)
- **f.[variablename]**: from node variable
- **t.[variablename]**: to node variable

### b) Modify code for your models

Modify the first line of code to include your selected variables, then uncomment it to run the code.

```{r}
#x = c("length", #insert names of your variables)
```

Now fit the model. You could change the grouping factor, but use either 'from' or 'to' consistently across all models.

```{r}
( gm.X <- GeNetIt::gravity(y = "Dps", x = x, d = "length", 
            group = "from_ID", data = cdata, method="ML") )
```

Plot the results:

```{r fig.height=5.5, fig.width=7}
par(mfrow=c(2,3))
for (i in 1:6) { plot(gm, type=i) } 
```

### c) Evaluate model fit

For each model, contemplate the diagnostic plots. Think about idealized expectations for each plot and how your models/data may diverge from these expectations. Below are the different plots.  
	
- **Plot 1**: Observed vs. expected.  
- **Plot 2**: residual error
- **Plot 3**: Q-Q Normal  - Origin
- **Plot 4**: Q-Q Normal – residuals
- **Plot 5**: Fitted values by origin (or destination, this is by the “grouped” factor). 
- **Plot 6**: Density, observed vs. expected.

**Question 5**: What is the meaning of plot 5?  

**Question 6**: 

- Is there any evidence that you may be violating regression assumptions for any of the models?  
- What steps could you take to accommodate any observed (potential) assumption violations?

**Question 7**: 

- Which model(s) have the highest support?  
- Do you get the same results with AIC compared to BIC scores?

**Question 8**: What additional variables might you hypothesize are related to production/attraction and/or resistance among sites?

### d) Fit your final model

For your final model, refit with REML for final model estimation.  For example:

```{r}
( gm.X <- GeNetIt::gravity(y = "Dps", x = x, d = "length", 
            group = "from_ID", data = cdata, method="REML") )
```
